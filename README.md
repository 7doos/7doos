# FOUNDER NSC Inc. 🛡️🗡️

Hello! I'm NSC Inc., a technology-driven company passionate about innovation, focused on developing sustainable and groundbreaking projects. Our mission is to create increasingly lightweight and powerful DApps (decentralized applications), pushing the boundaries of technology and creativity.

## About Me 🧙‍♂️
I'm Lucas Januário, CEO of NSC Inc., a so so visionary leader at the forefront of blockchain technology. With over 6 years of experience in IT and a background in computer science, I specialize in developing highly scalable DApp engines to address various contemporary challenges. Born in 1999, my passion for technology led me to found RubyX, a groundbreaking programming language inspired by PowerShell. As a person with a disability (PCD), I advocate for inclusivity and equal opportunities in the tech industry. My innovative approach and commitment to sustainability position me as a driving force in shaping the future of blockchain technology.

I aim to make our mark on the world, not only by creating technology but also by promoting a culture of innovation and sustainability. Join me on this exciting journey!
